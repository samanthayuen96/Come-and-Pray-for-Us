# Come and Pray for Us
A website for church-goers or other individuals to visually see updates of missionaries outside of Canada

What is a "missionary"? According to Merriam Webster, 'missions' in the context of a religious organization (which in this case is the Christian faith), involves sending individuals called "missionaries" whose vocation is to cross geographical boundaries in order to carry out and to spread its faith in some of the most unreached locations.

This website comes from an inspiration and dream I have for those who are called to and have a true passion for this vocation. For me, I do not see myself in missions; however, I do want to use my passion for developing technologies that can possibly create a bridge between missionaries and the users in the home country. I often see how it is difficult for missionaries to communicate back home for support all the time, but by creating a platform just for this communication, my hope is that it functions as a way to observe and to live through each missionary's experience from the very start to the very end (whether successful or unsuccessful).

I believe through this website that it can bring more awareness, reality, and weight to the lived experiences of these hardworking missionaries. Through it as individuals and believers of the same faith, we can support through prayerfully and financially when necessary.
